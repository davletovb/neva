## Why Neva?
Neva makes it simple to unlock the power of large language models through specialized AI agents. Benefits include:

- **Rapid Prototyping** - Quickly build conversational agents, productivity tools, game characters, and more.
- **Modular Components** - Switch between different types of LLMs. Mix and match configurable agents, tools, and environments.
- **Scalable Systems** - Develop complex ecosystems of hierarchical, coordinating agents.
- **Simulation Capabilities** - Model and evaluate agent behaviors under various conditions.
- **Community Resources** - Leverage shared agents, tools, and examples from our open-source community.

Neva empowers developers, researchers, educators, and hobbyists to create the next generation of AI interactions for gaming, automation, education, research, and beyond!

## Quickstart üöÄ
Dive right into Neva with our easy and intuitive quickstart guide. Whether you're a seasoned AI enthusiast or just exploring, you can access our collection of specialized AI agents, tools, and environments. Simply select the components you need, and customize them to your liking (like defining specific tasks or integrating with your favorite tools). With just a few clicks, you'll be ready to unleash the power of AI!

Use our handy code snippets to integrate Neva into your Python projects, GitHub repositories, or other platforms. It's that simple!

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davletovb/neva.git
cd neva
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dependencies include libraries such as `openai`, `transformers`, `wikipedia`, `googletrans`, and `bert-extractive-summarizer`.

## Usage
Create and simulate AI agents effortlessly:
```python
from environments import BasicEnvironment
from models import AgentManager
from schedulers import RoundRobinScheduler
from tools import MathTool

# 1. Create an agent using the manager
manager = AgentManager()
agent = manager.create_agent(
    "transformer",
    name="Tutor",
    llm_backend=lambda prompt: f"(stubbed model) {prompt}",
)
agent.register_tool(MathTool())

# 2. Prepare an environment and scheduler
scheduler = RoundRobinScheduler()
environment = BasicEnvironment("Classroom", "A simple maths lesson", scheduler)
environment.register_agent(agent)

# 3. Drive the simulation loop
for _ in range(3):
    response = environment.step()
    print(response)
```

Each call to ``environment.step`` asks the scheduler for an agent, collects
metrics via the observer system, and invokes the agent's ``respond`` method with
the current environmental context.  This mirrors the simulation lifecycle used
throughout the library and in the accompanying tests.

## Features
- **Flexible & Adaptable**: Adapt to various types of LLMs, tasks, and tools.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: Design agents for specific tasks and coordinate them harmoniously.
- **Intuitive Interfaces**: Simple interfaces for agent creation and management.
- **Environment Simulation**: Simulate environments for agent interactions and collaborations.
