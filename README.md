## Why ConcordAI?
ConcordAI is more than just an AI library; it's a game-changer for building and interacting with large language models. Here's why:

- **Flexible & Adaptable**: Switch between different types of LLMs, tasks, tools, and environments with ease.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: Build specialized mini-agents and coordinate them through outer agents.
- **Environment Simulation**: Create and simulate diverse environments where agents operate and interact.
- **Open Source & Community-Driven**: Join us in revolutionizing AI interactions under the MIT License.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concordai.git
cd concordai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Create and simulate AI agents effortlessly:
```python
from agents import AIAgent, Tool, Environment

# Create an AI agent
agent = AIAgent()

# Add tools
calculator_tool = Tool(name="Calculator", description="Performs basic arithmetic calculations")
agent.add_tool(calculator_tool)

# Create an environment
env = Environment()
env.add_agent(agent)

# Run the simulation
env.simulate(steps=100)
```

## Features
- **Flexible & Adaptable**: Adapt to various types of LLMs, tasks, and tools.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: Design agents for specific tasks and coordinate them harmoniously.
- **Intuitive Interfaces**: Simple interfaces for agent creation and management.
- **Environment Simulation**: Simulate environments for agent interactions and collaborations.
