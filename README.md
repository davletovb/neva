```

## Usage
Create and simulate AI agents effortlessly:
```python
from agents import AIAgent, Tool, Environment

# Create an AI agent
teacher = AIAgent()

# Add tools
calculator_tool = Tool(name="Calculator", description="Performs basic arithmetic calculations")
teacher.add_tool(calculator_tool)

# Create an environment
classroom = Environment()
classroom.add_agent(teacher)

# Run the simulation
env.simulate(steps=100)
```
