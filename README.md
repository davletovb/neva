# AI Agent Library

We're looking for machine learning enthusiasts and developers who are passionate about building and interacting with large language models in a multi-agent environment. If you love the idea of creating specialized AI agents that can work together, this project might be the game-changer for you!

## Description
The AI Agent Library is a Python library designed to create and manage AI agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The library supports the creation of specialized AI agents, task orchestration, and the integration of various tools like calculators and Wikipedia search. It also encourages building hierarchical agents where an outer agent can coordinate specialized mini agents.

## Installation
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Import the library into your project.

## Usage
Here's how to create an AI agent, add tools, and define environments:
```python
from ai_agent import AIAgent, Tool, Environment

# Create an AI agent
agent = AIAgent()

# Add tools
calculator_tool = Tool(name="Calculator", description="Performs basic arithmetic calculations")
agent.add_tool(calculator_tool)

# Create an environment
env = Environment()
env.add_agent(agent)

# Run the simulation
env.simulate(steps=100)
```
## Features
Flexible and Adaptable: Easily switch between different types of LLMs, tasks, tools, and environments.
Hierarchical Agents: Build agents that focus on specific tasks and coordinate with other agents.
Intuitive Interfaces: Simple but expressive interfaces for creating and managing agents.
Environment Simulation: Create environments where agents can operate and interact.
